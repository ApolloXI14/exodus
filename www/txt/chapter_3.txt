<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p>The excitement of the crowd rolled all the way down to the
preparation chamber set deep inside the coliseum. The floor and walls
of a circular room the size of a small house shuddered from the stomps
of hundred of thousands of excited people.  White pillars that
stretched from the polished stone floor all the way to the matching
ceiling divided the room into sections where the gladiators could
train, receive medical aid, or prepare for the next match. The walls
were sculpted with reliefs of past champions with goldenrod
resonance-crystals stylishly engraved to break the tedium of all the
white.</p>

<p>Maybe the decorated room -filled with all sorts of weapons, armor
and servants running around to attend to the warriors- was meant to
make the gladiators feel like royalty, but none of it mattered to the
King’s champion.  He kept his powerful arms held out as they strapped
on his lion-faced shoulder guard and a gladiator’s belt with two
bladed rings fitted in. They brought him his swords, buckler, and had
to concede when he waved away their attempts to spray him with oils
that would make him shine in the light for the King’s audience.
Another servant stood in front of him, relaying the King’s specific
orders that he put on a show worthy of a royal celebration.</p>

<p>“Now, your opponent is going-“The attendant was beginning to say,
but the large warrior – Ae’dron by name – began to walk for the door
before the human ever got to finish. “Move,” was all the warning he
gave, and that was enough to send all of the servants scrambling to
get out of his way. The man in charge of briefing the warrior tried to
follow after him. “B-but you’re not to enter until you’re announced!
You must-” He started, but Ae’dron silenced him with a gesture. “I
know the routine,” the warrior rumbled, turning to look at the man
with eyes that seemed more fitting on a lion. The attendant blanched
and backed away.</p>

<p>Despite the obvious threat in his voice, Ae’dron understood the
true source of the human’s fear. If the warrior broke protocol and
entered the field prematurely, that attendant who was in charge of
telling him the king’s orders would be put to death. If he pressed and
tried to hold Ae’dron back until the appropriate time, he could be
killed by the gladiator anyway.</p>

<p>Ae’dron put any pity he felt for the man out of his mind as he
began to walk up the hallway leading to the arena. With every step
closer, the ground shook even harder, and soon his walk became a trot
as his heartrate increased. With the thrill of battle, the roar of the
audience filling his ears and sending shivers of anticipation across
his skin, that trot became a run, and as he heard the announcer
begin,</p>

<p>“AND NOW I PRESENT TO YOU…!”</p>

<p>Right as she called his name, Ae’dron kicked the gates in without
ever slowing his run, and even the crowd’s ecstatic screams couldn’t
compare to the ferocity his roar!</p>

<br/>

<p>Moments earlier…</p>

<p>Even as the cyclops hit the ground, the gravity of Xoph’s
predicament was beginning to weigh on him. There was no escape, and
even if he performed admirably the king had no intention of letting
him leave the arena alive. The mage had come to visit the arena
several times before, but from the spectator seats it all looked like
a macabre game. Despite the very real brutality, something about the
levity of it all – the drinks and gambling, cheering and laughter –
had always made the arena feel like sport. In truth, Xoph realized, it
was a death sentence.</p>

<p>“AE’DRON THE TITAN!”</p>

<p>And there it was. The Executioner.</p>

<p>From Xoph’s perspective, the wildkin seemed more beast than man.
The warrior stood nearly eight feet tall, with broad shoulders, a
brown mane of dreadlocks, and a muscled torso armored only by an
ironwood buckler and a lion-sculpted shoulder plate that shined a
bronzed gold. His skin seemed more akin to a lion’s, complete with
tufts of hair around his shoulders and elbows. Feline features were
noticeable all across his form, from his eyes to his claws, but the
gladiator’s belt drew the most attention, stitched and braided with
various fibers and leathers to make a harness that was both flexible
and tough. His brown sandals had bladed weapons strapped to the sides
of his legs that Xoph could’ve sworn he saw writhing of their own free
will.</p>

<p>Xophorys knew that if it weren’t for the magic dampening radiation
in the atmosphere, he would’ve long teleported himself out. He had no
desire to be a hero, and even less so when Ae’dron’s roar both ignited
the crowd and turned his stomach. With that in mind, even he surprised
himself when he turned and quickly approached the other mages,
pointing to the orb that was even then hovering over their heads. He
noticed with a sardonic smile that he didn’t have to work to get their
attention; all eyes were on him anyway. He spoke before he had time to
think about what he was saying,</p>

<p>“If you want to live, stay back and let me handle this. The
champion of the arena -Ae’dron- is a wildkin, and felinus of clan Leo
at that. I’m sure you’ve all seen how adept they are in combat… Now I
need you to know and believe that he is at least fifty times deadlier
than any wildkin you’ve ever faced. Stay by the orb, and do NOT get
involved!”</p>
<p>One person had the audacity to laugh, “Hear that? He speaks as if
he knows the beast.”</p>
<p>“Like a brother,” Xoph responded sarcastically, “he’s won me a lot
of gold here. Trust me or not, it is your decision, but I hail from
Caelumpeak. In the Academy, we’ve learned abou-” Someone spat on the
ground. All-Father’s ass, did nobody in Shadarrin have respect for
Baldeming? “OK. Wow. Great conversation, already feeling less guilty
about your inevitable deaths, but…” He looked at them all, seeing that
they were honestly truly scared, despite the bravado of a few. “Try
not to perish, please.. And I’ll work on facilitating your
survival.”</p>

<p>Xoph had expected to hear some sort of protest. Some sort of
prideful retort about someone in the group being a war veteran or
something… He was disappointed, yet relieved, to find no complaints
and tried his best to give them all a reassuring smile and nod. Many
of the other captives were older than he, and most looked at him
incredulously, but Xoph’s academy training had taught him confidence
in the face of doubt was one of the best way to inspire others. With
that handled, he put the civilians, the audience, the court, and
everything else out of his mind as he began to focus on the most
literal fight of his life. His eye flashed just once and the larger of
the two glowing orbs began to orbit around him as the mage walked
calmly towards his opponents, hands in his pockets to hide the magical
gestures his fingers worked.</p>

<p>“I’d… Really rather not die today,” he muttered, the closest thing
the magician would get to a prayer, “it would be, eh, inconve-“</p>

<p>Ae’dron roared, muting him.</p>

<p>Ae’dron knew what he was up against. Even if he hadn’t known
beforehand, the floating balls and the stupid foppish outfit would’ve
given away long before he felt the tingle of magic in the environment.
“Mages,” he said with a clear tone of disgust, accentuating his point
by spitting on the ground. As his eyes scanned the environment and his
other senses were beginning to inform him of secrets in the air that a
human would never know of, the lion wildkin felt a familiar intrusion
into his mind.</p>

<p>“Mm, exotic prey for us today.” King Khoma’s voice rang in his
thoughts as if they were his own. Ae’dron tried to ignore it, but
Khoma pressed on, “Do not make it quick, nor quiet. Make it loud, a
spectacle worthy of me! Worthy of my-“</p>

<p>“Shut up!” Ae’dron roared, blocking the following outraged rant out
of his mind right as the mage sprung into action. The human had pulled
his hands out of his pocket, and seemed to be gathering light into his
palms. With an annoying smirk, the mage pointed both hands towards
Ae’dron. There was a momentary flash, the sound of bursting air, and
the energy fired off like cannons towards the warrior.</p>
<p>A quick pivot had the wildkin twisting out of the way of the
projectiles, but the spellcaster didn’t let up. Both of Xoph’s arms
pumped back and forth, each sending a constant barrage of volatile
blue lights at Ae’dron. The gladiator ducked one and dove over another
in the span of a second, rolling past a third as he sprang forward in
a charge. Moving like a racing cat, Ae’dron was closing in fast, and
brought up his buckler in time to guard his head from another arcing
energy blast. The force gave him momentum to spin off, claws scraping
gouges in the floor, before he lunged at Xophorys with both swords in
hand.</p>

<p>Even though Xoph had warned the others, he was still taken aback by
Ae’dron’s speed. He was thankful that he was able to predict the
hunter’s instinct, though, as he let a black vial slip from his sleeve
as Aedron leapt towards him. He brought his arms up in surprise when
the lion closed in, but suddenly vanished in a blink, a silhouette of
fire in his place. The gladiator braced himself through the flames as
he splashed down into what looked like a puddle of black tar.</p>

<p>And the puddle exploded into flames.</p>

<p>Xoph wasted no time, raising his arms and gesturing as if he was
trying to weave a basket. His fingers keyed in the specifics his
spell, his voice gave it power, and his orb flashed the same color as
his eyes. The wind picked up around Ae’dron, wrapping around his
flaming form in a vicious cyclone. The wildkin’s roars were drowned by
the screams of the crowd and whipping winds and his sihoulette was
barely visible among the dust and the fire but Xoph could see
Ae’dron’s form spinning uncontrollably off the ground, trapped with no
way out. The mage felt a smidge of guilt, this was exactly why
so-called “fighters” were inferior.</p>

<p>And why they were becoming irrelevent.</p>

<p>What use was a sword when the spell could do the same thing and so much more? Even with his magic dampened, Xophorys knew that there was nothing Ae’dron could do that he couldn’t counter. There was no way for the wildkin to even get close if Xoph didn’t allow it. Every Baldemian citizen knew that the only reason Baldeming hadn’t conquered the other regions was moreso a lack of desire than lack of ability. A trio of Academy spellcasters could obliterate an entire city, and if every mage on the mountain combined their power? What could stop them from sinking a continent?</p>

<p>The magician smiled at the thought, reinforced by the awe of the crowd. He spun dramatically to face the king’s court as the cyclone incinerated it’s prisoner. “Good King!” He dipped respectful bow. “Please, you must stop this! I am from CaelllaaaaHH!” Xoph’s words melted into a yell as a rope snared his leg and dragged him into the tornado. The rope -which turned out to be a vine- had come from Ae’dron. An intricate net of braided vines wrapped around his leg quicker than Xoph could react, and the veins of the flora pulsed with a blue light. The spellcaster gasped, suddenly feeling suffocated, as he recognized the anti-magic properties of the weapon!</p>
<p>As Xoph’s magic locked, the cyclone ceased, and Ae’dron landed holding the mage upside-down. A flick of Xoph’s wrist injected a dart into his own arm, but he only had one hand to bring up to block Ae’dron’s sword as it sliced in at his chest. Amazingly, his cloth sleeve turned the weapon without tearing though the impact till hurt his arm. Ae’dron quirked an eyebrow and growled. Xoph, upside-down, smiled slightly. “N-nice coat, right? Thanks.” Ae’dron suddenly looked up, his nose twitching, and he jumped away from an energy bolt from behind.</p>


<p>Xoph’s orbuculum pursued him.</p>


<p>“You’re welcome,” the mage, still captive, quietly answered himself. He was doing his best to use Aedron’s wrist and arms as leverage to kick him in the head and face while his orb chased the two. “Shut up!” Ae’dron yelled as he ducked and weaved a shower of energy blasts. He ended a backflip by slamming the tethered caster into the ground.</p>
<p>And the orb hesitated.</p>
<p>Ae’dron squinted at that, and his distraction cost him as Xoph’s foot smashed into his lower jaw. The wildkin let go of his ankle, but his net still had Xoph tethered by the leg. He pulled the human towards him and rapidly stabbed at him, Xoph couldn’t keep up with his strikes, but his orb protected him with pin-point lightning strikes deflecting every attack that he failed to block. Aedron over-wrapped his grip on the net and yanked Xoph hard, swinging him like a flail at the orb itself and batting it away. The mage yelped from the snap, and winced as he slammed into the ground. He yelled a breathless scream when the over four-hundred pound gladiator’s foot smashed down on his back. His instinct was to teleport, but the anti-magic vines (which were growing out of Ae’dron’s sword!) muted his magic.</p>

<p>Aedron roughly kicked him face-up, and placed a blade at his throat. Looking down at him Ae’dron – and thus Khoma – felt a sense of … familiarity about the human he was about to kill. It was the scent. Xophorys was terrified, clearly, but there was something familiar about him. Everyone had a unique scent-taste, and the felinus had a special gland in the roof of their mouths for detecting it. It told them about a person’s health, including diseases, wounds, and fertility, and at some point in his life he had met Xophorys before…</p>
<p>… His collar buzzed, deleting the thought.</p>

<p>“Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!” The crowd’s apetite for blood was ravenous, the whole arena felt like the jaws of a great beast demanding tribute.</p>
<p>“Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!” Xoph had to move. By the gods he HAD to! He injected himself with vials of strength AND speed, pushing against the lion’s leg. His heart thudded so loud he could feel it in his ears and he was so desperately fighting the memories flashing through his mind. This wasn’t how things were supposed to go.</p>
<p>“Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!”</p>
<p>Ae’dron, impossibly strong, wouldn’t budge. He looked up to the court for approval to finish the job. Khoma, who was quite pleased, nodded.</p>
<p>“Kill!”</p>
<p>Xoph willed his magic, reaching further and harder than ever. Nothing.</p>
<p>“Kill!”</p>
<p>Ae’dron roared, raised his arm, and aimed his sword down at Xophorys’s face.</p>
<p>“Kill!”</p>
<p>Was the last thing Xoph heard before the blade plunged.</p>
